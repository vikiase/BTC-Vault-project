# BTC Vault (V1.0) - Stack Sats for your Better Future!

## Introduction
**BTC Vault** is a command-line application designed for Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and other investment strategies, primarily focused on Bitcoin (BTC). This project was inspired by the **stosuj.cz** platform created by Luboš Kovářík, whom I greatly admire. I would like to thank him for his work, and this project is non-commercial.

The main goal of this project is to showcase my technical skills in **Python**, **API**, **Git**, **data handling**, **automation**, **encryption**, **modularity - program organization**, and most importantly, **creating a meaningful and practical project**. The aim is to provide a practical tool for users who want to automate their BTC investment strategies.

## How It Works
The application interacts with **Coinmate API** to automate BTC purchases. Users must have an account on the Coinmate exchange, as the platform executes orders directly on their account. Additionally, users must have sufficient funds on the exchange for the strategy to function properly.

The main feature is the **DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) strategy** for investing in Bitcoin. Users can configure their strategy using the following parameters:
- **Interval**: Define how often purchases are made (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Investment Amount**: Specify how much to invest in each transaction.
- **Price Limit**: Set a price limit to ensure advantageous purchases.

This strategy is designed to minimize the negative impact of market volatility and increase the likelihood of achieving long-term success in the crypto market.

## Key Benefits
- **Security**: I do not have access to any funds in your account. In the event of a security breach, your funds remain safe in your Coinmate account, and no one (including me) can access them.
- **Fully Automated**: Once the strategy is set, the application runs automatically and executes purchases according to the chosen investment strategy without manual intervention.
- **Customizable**: The DCA strategy allows users to tailor their investments to match their risk profile and financial goals.

**BTC Vault** is a powerful tool for anyone looking to make consistent, long-term investments in Bitcoin, maintain control over their funds, and minimize exposure to short-term market fluctuations.
